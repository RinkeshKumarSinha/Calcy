Simple calculator

This HTML document includes a simple calculator interface with buttons for digits (0-9) and basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /). The JavaScript functions appendToDisplay, clearDisplay, and calculateResult handle the user input and perform the necessary calculations. The eval function is used to evaluate the mathematical expression entered by the user. Note that using eval can have security implications, and in a production environment, it is recommended to implement a safer method for evaluating expressions.
